Hi there this is just a little color-picker tool I built some time ago.
After I found a similar tool on macOS and was missing it on Windows.


Just downlod the repo and start in Visual Studio.

This tool will show you the color of the current pixel under your cursor.
By hitting key 's' you can store the current value to copy the color Hex-code.
